# Todo

A lot!

1. GraphViz (and LightGraph?) plots from the DAG model.
2. @DAG (vs. the current Dict formulation).
3. Method `adjustment_sets(dag, paths)` - options for conditioning
4. Method `impliedConditionalIndependencies()`
7. Other mixed graphs based on Sadeghi work for ggm
8. Documentation
9. Tests
10. ...


More testing:

1. Method `all_paths(dag, :x, :y)` - find all paths between nodes :f and :l.
2. Method `backdoor_paths(dag, paths, :x)` - which are backdoor paths to :x?
3. Method `open_paths(dag, paths)` - which paths are open?
4. Method `show_dag_path(dag, path)` - show path directions using arrows
5. Dagitty & ggm conversion routines
6. ...
