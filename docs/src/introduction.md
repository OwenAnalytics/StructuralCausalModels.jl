# Introduction

These are some very, very early tests to see what it would take to create a Julia version of the [SCM primer book](http://bcs.wiley.com/he-bcs/Books?action=index&bcsId=10288&itemId=1119186846).

Important links are:

1. [Dagitty](http://www.dagitty.net/)
2. [R dagitty package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dagitty/index.html)

and particularly:

3. [R ggm package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggm/index.html)

My initial goal for this package to have a minimal way to apply SCM ideas to the examples in [StatisticalRethinking.jl](https://github.com/StatisticalRethinkingJulia).

A secondary goal is to have a structure to hold model info. Currently I'm experimenting with this package, with MCMCModels.jl and MCMCParameters.jl.

This package is not registered and might never be!!!!
